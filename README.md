IF YOU WOULD LIKE TO HIRE ME FOR DEVELOPMENT OF JAVA DESKTOP, MOBILE (iOS AND ANDROID), TV, IoT OR SERVER (JavaEE) APPS, PLEASE CONTACT ME AT roman@pronic.si !!!

Notify your buddies of the pub you're at. The application enables you to mark the GPS location of the pub with one click and invite your BlackBerry® Messenger (BBM™), Facebook®, Twitter®, SMS and E-mail buddies to join you.

Send your drinking buddies an express invitation with the pub's address, meeting time, GPS coordinates and link to BlackBerry® Maps (Google® Maps link for Facebook® wall posts and Twitter® tweets). Choose among 21 invitations ranging from general to more specific invites (birthday, celebration, etc.) or personalize the invite yourself. Connect with your friends!

Some examples of invites:
- Work was hell. I need to get it off my chest. Meet me for a drink at …
- Gossip Girl is in town. Don't miss the latest dish. Meet me at…
- Damn! My car is broken. I'll buy you a drink if you pick me up at…
- You feeling lucky? I'll buy you a drink at…
- I just realised I lost my wallet with all my drinking money. I'll be accepting donations at…
- It's my birthday, drinks are on me. I'll be accepting gifts at our favourite pub…

!!! Make sure you have installed BBM™ 6 (BlackBerry® Messenger v6.0 or higher).

!!! The recipient doesn't require Beer Buddy to receive your invitation and can RSVP via BlackBerry® Messenger (v5 or higher).

!!! If GPS doesn't lock your position, make sure you're in an open space and try again by pressing on the ‘Where am I' button.
